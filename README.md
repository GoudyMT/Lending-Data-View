# Machine Learning Dataset Preparation and Analysis

## Overview
This project is part of the Machine Learning/AI Foundations skill path, showcasing the application of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and preparation of a dataset for machine learning modeling. The analysis is conducted in a Jupyter Notebook and shared via GitHub to demonstrate skills relevant to data science and machine learning engineering roles.

The goal is to prepare a clean, well-structured dataset ready for machine learning, highlighting proficiency in data cleaning, feature engineering, and EDA using Python and popular libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib/Seaborn.

*Note: This project is in progress, and this README will be updated as the analysis evolves.*

## Project Objectives
- **Data Acquisition**: Source a dataset suitable for machine learning (e.g., from Kaggle, UCI, or another open repository).
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
  - Perform data transformations (e.g., normalization, encoding categorical variables).
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Visualize key patterns and relationships using plots (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, correlation heatmaps).
  - Identify features that may impact model performance.
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Create new features to enhance model interpretability and performance.
  - Select relevant features based on EDA insights.
- **Dataset Preparation**:
  - Output a clean dataset ready for machine learning modeling (e.g., train-test split, feature scaling).
- **Documentation**:
  - Clearly document the process in a Jupyter Notebook with code, visualizations, and explanations.

## Planned Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy
  - Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - Machine Learning (future steps): Scikit-learn
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
